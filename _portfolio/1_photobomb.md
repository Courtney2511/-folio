**Assignment**:

Develop a RESTful Python/Flask application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/photobomb/photobomb.png" alt="" title="photo example"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Photo Post example
</div>


**Project Details**:  

<a href="http://photobomb.courtneynoonan.com">Photobomb</a> is a photo sharing application where users can upload a link to a photo along with a title and description for it, as well as associate the photo with a category.  Photos on the site can be viewed by anyone, but to be able to add a photo you must be a user.  Users can create an account either through the application, or through integration with Facebook Login.  Only photo owners can edit or delete the photo once it has been added to the site.

The project required that I implement one API endpoint for an arbitrary item in the catalog.  This inspired me to take the requirement a little bit further and serve all the item data from a python API application to be consumed by a React front-end application.  As I had no previous experience with React, this project as required that I self learn React along with Redux for state management.

**Technologies**:

* Python 2.7
* Flask
* React.js
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS
