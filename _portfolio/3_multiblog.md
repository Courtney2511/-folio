**Assignment**:

Develop a Python blog app that supports multiple users with the ability to comment on others posts.  Users must be logged in to view and comment on posts.

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

**Project Details**:

MultiBlog is a basic multi-user blogging site that allows users to create accounts and then share blog posts.  Cookies are used for user authentication.  As an extra in the assignment, I added the ability for users to 'like' each others posts.

Build registration functionality with validation and error messages
