**Assignment**:

Design and develop a Kickstarter clone.  

Minimum expectation for the project: Projects have deadlines, and expire when that deadline is reached, projects can only be deleted by the project owner, and only if it has not raised any money, and projects can continue to receive funding past their funding goal.

** Learning objectives **

 * To get a feel for what it is like to work on a real project
 * To become more comfortable with integrating JavaScript into a Rails application
 * Gain more experience using jQuery and AJAX to make a site more responsive
 * Gain some experience working in pairs or groups on a software project
 * To learn how to prioritize user stories in order to deliver a minimal viable product
