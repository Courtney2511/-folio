**Assignment**

For the Bitmaker final group project we had the opportunity to partner with a non profit organization and were given 2 weeks to bring their project ideas into reality.

**Project Details**

Our group partnered with Starts With Me, a youth mental health advocacy group.  The goal of the project was to create a social network where members could share various forms of artwork (drawing, poetry, photography, video and music) with each other to express their feelings and draw on the support of others in the group.


**Technologies**

* Ruby on Rails
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* sorcery gem for authentication
* carrier wave gem for file uploading
